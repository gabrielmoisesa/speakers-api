# Talkers Api üó£Ô∏è

The Talkers Api is a simple REST API designed for managing a collection of talkers. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to interact with talker data. This API is ideal for applications that require a backend system to handle speaker profiles, interviews, or any scenario where managing talkers' information is essential.
